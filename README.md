# 🔒 Securing Python Code with Bandit

This project focuses on securing Python code using the Bandit tool, which identifies security vulnerabilities in Python applications. Ensure to review and address the issues flagged by Bandit for improved code security.

## 📖 Overview

This project uses Bandit to scan Python code for security vulnerabilities and provides recommendations to mitigate risks. It helps developers improve code quality and adhere to secure coding practices.

## 🛠️ Features

- Identify security vulnerabilities in Python code.
- Provide recommendations for improving code security.
- Command-line interface for scanning Python projects.

## 🚀 How to Execute the Program

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Bandit:**
